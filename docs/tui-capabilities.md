# TUI capability coverage

The current capability target is **TUI 0.4.12**; see [version and evidence baseline](open-source-status.md#version-and-evidence-baseline) for the separate workspace and embedded-tool versions. “Restored” below describes implementation and assembly, not acceptance of every account or online service.

The evidence column summarizes the historical TUI 0.3.11 restoration record from 2026-09-11. It does not claim fresh TUI 0.4.12 live-service acceptance. Use [current verification status](verification.md#current-source-verification-status) for checks run against the updated source and explicit NOT RUN boundaries.

| Capability | Implementation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MiniMax login, logout, Token Plan, quota, check-in | OAuth Core, account clients, and TUI / CLI entry points restored | Login-state, auth-command, check-in, provider, and ACP tests; production Token Plan session and resume passed |
| BYOK / custom models | Retained; headless model overrides no longer inherit the default Token Plan login requirement | Local protocol server drives runtime, resume, and file tools; live BYOK session passed; managed models still reject unauthenticated requests |
| GitHub Copilot provider (fork addition) | Connector signs in to a Copilot subscription and reads the account's live `/models` catalog: per-model context and output limits, the reasoning-effort levels the account reports, and the wire protocol each model advertises. Sign-in is the GitHub device flow through pi's Copilot OAuth provider, or a token supplied out of band; the credential stays in the provider credential store | Discovery and connector tests run against a captured catalog; live completions passed on `openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages` and `openai-completions`; `kcode exec` passed end to end on all three protocols and in all four egress modes. Both TUI entry points carry the connect action and run the device flow: the model picker row, and a `/provider` row that Runtime synthesizes from the sign-in status before any entry exists. Once the connector has written its entry, that entry is the only Copilot row — Codex instead keeps its synthetic row beside the entry. The enterprise API host is unit-tested only |
| mcode-tools | Public package's unchanged 0.0.4 artifact, launcher, and short-lived token leases restored | Archive SHA-512, CLI SHA-256, real CLI startup, lease and host integration tests; production shared-broker authentication passed |
| Search and Matrix image / audio / video tools | Matrix MCP and tool assembly restored; search is independent of mcode-tools | MCP configuration and auth-isolation tests; actual search passed; generation requests not run |
| Official and local plugins; runtime GitHub importer | `/plugins` and `kcode plugin` manage official installations and discovered local packages; arbitrary marketplace registration and GitHub URL import are not exposed in the CLI/TUI. See [plugin management](examples.md#4-manage-plugins) | Plugin application, source-page, and offline local CLI tests; actual official catalog read passed |
| Managed connectors | Cloud client, permissions, and invocation adapters restored | Connector runtime and cloud transport tests; actual tool discovery passed; business writes not run |
| Updates | Update entry points, install-source detection, and signature verification restored; public packages use public npm | Update application and service tests; no real installation / upgrade on the development machine |
| Feedback and diagnostic uploads | Reviewed feedback text and minimized diagnostic summaries | Synthetic fixtures exercise session collection and capture/decode the final ZIP upload; no live uploads or real content |
| Automatic LLM error reports | Removed in this fork; there is no diagnostic transport | The reporter module is absent and `registry-client`/`agent.minimax.*` endpoints are refused by the egress guard |
| Telemetry | Removed in this fork: no usage events, no metrics transport, no diagnostic uploads, no `telemetry` config block | `packages/tui/test/unit/egress-guard.test.ts` asserts reporting hosts are refused at both transport chokepoints |
| Auto permissions | Cloud classifier restored; local rules and confirmation on failure retained | Classifier client, permission facade, and sandbox tests |
| Model catalog | Online catalog and bundled snapshot fallback restored | Actual build boundary checks and offline startup; online catalog contents not accepted |
| Files, shell, subagents, sessions, headless, ACP | Actual runtime retained | BYOK, file reads, session resume, ACP, sandbox, and status protocol tests |
| Built-in skills, MCP, plugin tools | Original TUI assets and activation conditions retained | Asset build, plugin, and MCP tests; no claim that every skill has passed a real task |

## ACP Skill commands

ACP clients receive enabled Skills alongside built-in slash commands when a session
is created, loaded, resumed, or forked. Discovery uses the session's Agent and
workspace, including installed plugin Skills. Command names come from the runtime
Skill roster (for example, `/review` or `/plugin:review`), not the installation
package name. Select a command and append instructions to invoke it through the
normal Agent turn. `/skills [filter]` lists the session's available Skills.

Built-in command names take priority over conflicting Skill names. Disabled,
duplicate, and invalid command names are omitted. If Skill discovery fails,
built-in commands remain available. Reopen the session after installing or enabling
Skills to refresh its command menu. Protocol tests cover command discovery and
prompt forwarding; this does not establish live Zed or model acceptance.

## Desktop boundary

Background workspace indexing is removed from this distribution. Runtime startup and conversation turns do not collect workspace snapshots, create workspace ZIP archives, or upload/retry them for cloud indexing. The semantic workspace search tool and its enablement policy are also removed; a saved indexing preference cannot reactivate them. Existing indexing records are left inert. User-directed file reading, search, and Git operations remain available.

Desktop features not enabled by default in the original TUI are outside this restoration commitment: remote encrypted prompt updates, cloud session handoff, and native Electron desktop control. Earlier descriptions incorrectly counted removal of those sources as TUI feature loss. Desktop HTTP services and internal generated IDL remain outside the public repository.

Website deployment tools and routes follow the original tool set. Successful deployment still depends on login, service permissions, and backend support; no real deployment has been performed.

## Release boundary

Production client paths are restored without internal registries or test-service addresses as build dependencies. Real account behavior, quota, billing, model quality, media generation, and deployment require separate acceptance. Mocks, protocol fixtures, successful builds, and the source import do not replace that evidence. Public npm `latest` was 0.4.12 on 2026-09-18; that metadata observation does not validate the installed package or deploy a backend. See [verification records](verification.md) and the historical [release audit](release-audit.md) for recorded acceptance results.

## Diagnostic upload privacy

Automatic LLM error reports use an allowlist before buffering and encryption. Schema 3 retains a numeric release version, the fixed metric error category, known error names/codes, HTTP statuses (100–599), and bounded error/cause/properties relationships. It excludes error messages, stacks, headers (including native `Headers`), prompts, request/model metadata, URLs, arbitrary property names/values, and binary data. Unknown event types are dropped; the event type and code location are fixed at the reporter boundary. Encryption remains a transport layer, not redaction. Authenticated transport still uses the signed-in account token and user ID.

The separate TUI incident reporter uses schema 2. It retains a fixed event category, phase/severity/impact, handled flag, generated IDs, timestamps, numeric release/Node versions, known platform/architecture, known error names/codes and HTTP status, and up to 20 fixed breadcrumb names with an optional phase. It excludes free-form error text, stack/cause/aggregate contents, caller context, component/operation labels, terminal/OS strings, and original code locations. Fingerprints are derived only from the minimized category and error facts, so grouping is intentionally coarser. Legacy schema-1 pending and sent files are deleted best-effort at startup and never uploaded; current-schema pending files are projected again before encryption and replaced with their minimized copy before being marked sent. The gateway wire encryption format is unchanged. Production ingestion of schema 2 has not been tested.

Feedback review describes the actual upload: user-reviewed feedback text, bounded client/platform and optional session metadata, and diagnostic **counts**, not original session files. Recognized credentials are redacted from the reviewed description; arbitrary personal text in that description is still sent, so review it before submitting.

Every collected diagnostic artifact, including prioritized session artifacts, is projected through `diagnostic-counts-v1`. The ZIP contains counts of known roles, states, error types/codes, log levels and HTTP statuses, plus parsing/omission indicators. JSON/JSONL can contribute these facts; malformed data, binary attachments and free-text logs contribute no raw content. Source filenames and paths are replaced with opaque archive names; only a small fixed list of artifact kinds (such as `messages.jsonl`) is retained. Unrelated session manifests are not collected. Local source files are unchanged.

There is no raw-attachment upload option in this flow. Prompts, conversation text, tool arguments/results, command output, workspace excerpts, raw errors and unknown fields are excluded even if they contain no recognizable credential pattern. This intentionally reduces diagnostic detail: reproducing an exact response or inspecting an original stack is not possible from these uploads. Future raw attachments would require a separate, explicit review and consent surface describing their contents and scope.

The regression tests use temporary synthetic files and intercepted HTTP only. They decrypt the final automatic-report request as a receiver would, and unzip the actual feedback PUT body after real session-report collection. They do not validate production ingestion, retention policies, live services, or other platforms.

## Interactive startup model

Use `kcode -m <provider-id>/<model-id>` or
`kcode "Fix the failing tests" --model <provider-id>/<model-id>` to select the
model for the startup Session. References use the same syntax as `exec --model`,
including `custom_provider:<id>/<model-id>`, model IDs containing `/`, and the
optional `#variant` suffix. The provider must already be configured and the model
must be available to Runtime; invalid references fail before the initial prompt runs.

Without a resume option, this creates a new Session even when no prompt is given.
With `--session <id>` or `--continue`, it updates the opened Session's model before
submitting the prompt. The selection is saved with that Session, so later turns
and resumes keep it. It does not change the global default, and `/new` returns to
the configured default. Omitting `--model` preserves existing startup behavior.
The untargeted `--session` picker cannot be combined with `--model`; provide an ID
or use `--continue` instead. If opening or continuing a Session fails, the override
and initial prompt are not applied.

## Feature panels and chat restoration

In regular mode, independent feature panels occupy the complete visible terminal
area, including short Rewind previews and scope pickers. Closing a panel restores
the current conversation. When running content shrinks entirely within the current
screen, the renderer keeps native scrollback and the Composer position stable.
Freed rows temporarily remain blank at the top of the active screen and subsequent
output reuses them. This avoids resetting the host's scroll position when a turn
finishes. Redundant resize notifications with unchanged dimensions do not rebuild
history.

When a change removes or replaces text already in scrollback, the renderer still
reconstructs the current session to avoid stale or duplicate history. Real resizes
and image layout changes also retain the existing reconstruction behavior. A
reconstruction clears earlier shell scrollback and can reset the host's scroll
position; ordinary updates keep native scrolling and selection behavior.

Rewind and Fork history-loading hints disappear as soon as their lists are ready.
Returning from a cancelled operation must not leave a stale loading message in the
Composer. Rewind displays its completed result after a successful operation.

## Temporary side conversations

Use `/btw [question]` (or `/side [question]`) to open a temporary side conversation
while the main task continues. The side conversation inherits the latest complete
prefix of persisted history. Completed tool calls retain all their results; an
unfinished group of tool calls is excluded together. The selected boundary is
fixed before creation, so later main-task output does not change that fork.
Inherited tool calls are context and are not executed again.

Press `Ctrl+/` to switch between the main and side views, or `/parent` to return
to the main view. Press `Ctrl+C` on an empty Composer to discard the side
conversation. Side conversations retain the main session's permission mode and
remain hidden from `/sessions` and `/resume`.

Creation and activation failures record a bounded, redacted cause chain in the
local `session.side.failed` diagnostic event. Feedback uploads still apply the
existing diagnostic-counts projection; raw error text, stacks and session IDs
are not added to the uploaded ZIP. Offline tests cover persisted tool histories,
archives, concurrent parent output, side-session cleanup and local diagnostics;
this does not establish native-terminal or live-model acceptance.
