# Welcome UI maintenance

Welcome separates design assets, layout, and terminal mechanics. Designers generally only need to edit this directory.

- `design.ts` is the single visual configuration entry point: character logo, wordmark, slogan, tips, news, and responsive hero thresholds.
- `component.ts` owns wide, stacked, and compact layouts, not theme detection or runtime lifecycle.
- `hero.ts` maps design assets to the current theme's gradient hero. Change it only when adjusting responsive selection or coloring.

Welcome and `/changelog` share the local changelog bundled with the package. `CHANGELOG.md` is the English default and fallback; `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md` is the Chinese version. A system locale with language `zh` selects Chinese; other languages select English. For each release, keep version headings synchronized and provide at least three entries per language for Welcome.

The hero always uses the same ANSI Shadow glyphs: the full `KINETICK CODE` at 94 columns or more, the six-line `KCODE` at 41–93 columns, and the same `K` glyph at 8–40 columns. Do not invent a separate pixel font or stack `KINETICK` / `CODE` on narrow screens. Compact Welcome must still render the hero and show the product name only once in the frame header.

Shared colors live in `src/tui/theme/palettes.ts`; borders and terminal-width adaptation live in `src/tui/shell/frame.ts`. Initial theme detection and rendering gates belong to infrastructure in `src/tui/theme/render-binding.ts` and `src/tui/renderer/interactive-renderer.ts`. Do not add startup sequencing to Welcome.

Validate copy, colors, and artwork visually. For responsive layout, visibility, or state changes in this standalone repository, run the relevant test from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.oss.config.mjs packages/tui/test/unit/tui-shell-chrome.test.ts
```
