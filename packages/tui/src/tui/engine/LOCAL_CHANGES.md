# MCode TUI Engine local changes

This ledger starts at the exact Pi source baseline recorded in `BASELINE.json`. It records every
MCode-owned difference from that baseline.

| L009 | Editor integration     | `components/editor.ts` generic adapter hooks and `index.ts` type export | Add serializable state capture/restore, range replacement, paste interception, autocomplete telemetry and undo extension state so the duplicate MCode editing state machine can be deleted.     | All generic editing behavior now executes in Pi Editor; the product wrapper owns only Draft persistence and attachment identity.                  | Complete Pi Editor corpus; Engine delta test; product Draft/attachment/failed-submit tests |
| L011 | Fullscreen interaction | `layout.ts`, `tui-alt-screen.ts` and `public.ts` mouse dispatch         | Route SGR press, drag and release events through the rendered Pi layout before Alt text selection, using layout-local coordinates and deepest-target precedence.                                | Fullscreen product interactions such as Plan Review remain mouse-operable without restoring the deleted product-owned selection or renderer path. | Alt renderer integration; Chat layout; Inline panel; Plan Review mouse tests               |

| L021 | Pi capability          | `terminal-image.ts` and `index.ts`                                      | Add Pi-compatible environment and host overrides for image protocol, true-color and hyperlink capability detection (Pi `e86823096c5bad39e1ca282ec24bc5eb9bec745b`).                             | QA and hosts can force deterministic terminal capability behavior while conservative auto-detection remains the default.                          | Pi 0.84.4 capability override API; capability focused test                                 |
| L022 | Product input | `components/editor.ts` | Add a display-only empty-editor placeholder using standard cursor, width, and padding rendering. | Guide initial input without writing placeholder text into the editable draft or duplicating engine layout. | Product editor behavior and focused TUI application tests |
| L023 | Terminal theme tracking | `terminal-colors.ts` and `tui.ts` | Extract OSC 11 responses and DEC 2031 reports within each chunk, then dispatch remaining input instead of dropping the whole chunk. | Detect theme changes even when reports share a read chunk with normal input, without swallowing keys. | `tui-terminal-color-sequences.test.ts`; upstream-pinned parser cases unchanged |
| L029 | Product readability | `components/markdown.ts` | Render link labels in an isolated context so inner body / heading ANSI colors cannot override link styling. | Preserve nested bold, italic, inline code, wrapping, and table link semantics; restore outer styling afterward. | `tui-markdown-readability.test.ts`; Engine Markdown corpus |
| L024 | Product input | `keys.ts` | Add the minimal legacy-terminal mapping where `Ctrl+/` and `Ctrl+_` share `0x1F`, supporting the `/btw` side-session shortcut. | Legacy terminals match `Ctrl+/`; kitty and modifyOtherKeys retain distinct sequences. | `tui-keybindings.test.ts`; baseline verifier |
| L025 | Long-session search | `alt-screen-search.ts` and `tui-alt-screen.ts` | Reuse the corpus and matches during active search; invalidate on content or width changes. | Repeated navigation does not rebuild Unicode coordinates. | `tui-search-index.test.ts` |
| L026 | Streaming display | `components/markdown.ts` | Cache stable blocks, retain two trailing blocks, and fall back to full parsing for reference definitions. | Preserve canonical per-character output while reducing repeated parsing of long replies. | `tui-markdown-stream.test.ts`; Pi Markdown corpus |
| L027 | Continuous resize | `tui.ts` and `tui-main-screen.ts` | Add a resize hook, immediately draw the visible tail, and replay history after 150ms. | Keep input visible during resize and restore ordered history after stabilization and exit. | `tui-resize-replay.test.ts`; Pi render/shrink corpus |
| L028 | Notification focus | `terminal.ts` and `tui.ts` | Record focus reports and forward them to viewport listeners; do not send focus sequences to the editor. | Product focus suppression is configurable; cmux focus remains host-owned. | `tui-terminal-focus.test.ts`; `tui-terminal-notifications.test.ts` |

| L030 | Shell completion | `autocomplete.ts` and `components/editor.ts` | Add optional `shouldAutoTriggerCompletion` and candidate `applyOnEnter` policies so providers control automatic triggering and Enter behavior. | Shell typing does not open completion automatically. Tab opens or accepts it; Enter always submits current text. Open menus keep filtering. Invalid forced-completion context immediately cancels requests and clears menus, including removal of the shell marker or an empty command prefix. `/` and `@` keep their defaults. | `tui-bash-autocomplete.test.ts`, product editor behavior, and upstream editor tests |

`L010` was retired after the ownership review. cmux owns focused-surface notification suppression
and does not provide a reliable product-level focus contract through `CSI 1004`; gating notification
emission on that signal could suppress every completion. The Engine focus changes were removed,
returning `terminal.ts` to the exact Pi baseline and leaving Pi Alt's existing focus/mouse behavior
unchanged. That historical decision still applies to cmux. L028 only adds a configurable focus policy for other terminals; cmux does not use this signal to suppress notifications.

The superseded custom Kernel, logical Main document, renderer lifecycle split, custom terminal,
custom scheduler and Engine preview Host were removed during the Pi reset. They are not part of the
fork contract and must not be reintroduced as compatibility infrastructure.

Future entries must include:

- the concrete MCode product contract that Pi cannot satisfy;
- the smallest source difference needed;
- user-visible behavior impact;
- focused evidence;
- the condition under which the difference can be removed.

Pi-specific environment variables, symbol names and package-layout assumptions remain unchanged from
the imported Pi baseline. Product integration should pass supported constructor options first. A Pi
source change is allowed only after a real MCode integration problem is demonstrated.

`L011` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline exposes equivalent layout-targeted component
mouse dispatch and MCode has migrated to that upstream contract.

`L016` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline contains equivalent child stdout/stderr error
containment for fd-backed autocomplete.

`L017` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline contains the bounded terminal writer and MCode
no longer needs the NodeNext-adapted copy of that implementation.

`L018` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline orders direct and recursive autocomplete matches
with the same depth, length and path tie-breakers.

`L019` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline treats path and kebab-case separators as word
selection joiners.

`L020` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline exposes the same fullscreen selection-copy
options and helpers used by MCode hosts.

`L021` can be removed once the selected Pi baseline exposes equivalent host and environment
capability overrides and MCode no longer needs a product-facing Engine export for them.

`L022` supports a per-frame `render(width, placeholder)` override, falling back to the constructor option when omitted. `/btw` supplies display copy only; it no longer slices and replaces rendered editor lines, avoiding truncation of the zero-width cursor marker after padding. Drafts, history, and submitted text are unchanged. Evidence: regular / fullscreen cursor regression in `tui-composer-cursor.test.ts` and the per-frame placeholder contract in `editor-behavior.test.ts`.

Remove `L022` when the selected Pi baseline provides equivalent display-only placeholders and per-frame overrides. Remove `L023` when it extracts OSC 11 / DEC 2031 within chunks and dispatches remaining input. Remove `L029` when equivalent link-style isolation is available.

Remove `L024` when the selected Pi baseline natively matches legacy-terminal `Ctrl+/` codes. Remove L025–L028 when it provides the same search-index cache, incremental Markdown, resize replay, and optional focus-report contracts. Remove `L030` when equivalent context-trigger callbacks and Enter completion policies are available.

## L031: Focused panel keyboard paging ownership

- Product contract: standalone readers such as changelog draw fixed headers and footers at actual window height and scroll their own body. Outer fullscreen handling of PgUp / PgDn would consume those keys first.
- Minimal difference: optional `handlesViewportKeys` on Component; TuiAltScreen checks the focused component before keyboard viewport navigation. Components without it retain existing behavior; mouse and global search are unchanged.
- User impact: paging scrolls fixed-frame panel content instead of being swallowed by an empty outer viewport.
- Evidence: `tui-chat-layout.test.ts` sends actual PgDn / PgUp sequences through VirtualTerminal; `tui-alt-screen.test.ts` verifies default scrolling; built CLI regular / fullscreen PTY checks at 40×12 change changelog lines from 1–5 to 5–9.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline provides equivalent focused-component keyboard-navigation ownership and MCode migrates to it.

## L032: Continuous command-argument completion

- Product contract: `/plan`, `/permission`, and `/goal` arguments appear immediately after command completion. Selecting an argument only fills the draft; a space after the command must not cause file-trigger gating to block Tab.
- Minimal difference: `autocomplete.ts` marks command-name candidates with `continueCompletion` and slash results with `kind`, using `shouldAutoTriggerCompletion` for argument context. Failed or cancelled argument callbacks return empty results. `components/editor.ts` follows marked candidates, determines Enter behavior by candidate phase, and reuses provider-declared argument context for explicit Tab.
- User impact: Tab continues from command to argument; accepting arguments remains separate from submission. Commands without argument candidates, file references, and shell input keep their existing behavior.
- Focused evidence: `test/unit/tui-command-argument-autocomplete.test.ts` covers product assembly, aliases, descriptions, Tab / Enter / Esc, cursor suffixes, slash arguments, failures, and delayed results. Existing file, shell, editor, catalog, active-run-flow, and upstream editor / autocomplete tests verify compatibility.
- Removal condition: migrate back when the selected Pi baseline supports equivalent candidate phases and continuous command-argument completion. Product commands and runtime data remain product-owned.

## L033: Strip OSC 133 navigation markers in normal mode

- Product contract: OSC 133 A/B/C zones are internal navigation metadata and must not reach a normal-mode terminal.
- Change: strip leading zone prefixes before comparing screen lines, so initial frames, differential redraws, and history caches stay clean. Fullscreen behavior is unchanged.
- Evidence: `test/unit/tui-engine-local-deltas.test.ts` checks initial and differential writes.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline supplies equivalent normal-mode filtering.

## L035: Fullscreen scrollbar track interaction

- Origin: adapted from [drowzeys/minimax-code commit 0b24a7778741fda335a9a2074464c69911feb1aa](https://github.com/drowzeys/minimax-code/commit/0b24a7778741fda335a9a2074464c69911feb1aa), contributed by drowzeys under the existing MIT license in [issue #216](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/minimax-code/issues/216).
- Product contract: the fullscreen transcript enables an always-visible scrollbar with a three-column hit gutter. Track presses center the thumb and jump before dragging; thumb presses retain their grab offset without an initial jump.
- Minimal difference: `components/scroll-view.ts` accepts an optional `scrollbarGutter` for always-visible bars, defaulting to one column and retaining at least one content column on narrow terminals. `tui-alt-screen.ts` restricts wide hit targets to that reserved gutter, factors drag mapping into `dragScrollbarTo`, and cancels a drag when an overlay receives the next mouse event. Auto bars retain a one-column target. `layout.ts` stays at the Pi baseline.
- Adaptation: the original contribution widened hits over two live content columns. The reserved gutter prevents those presses from swallowing content clicks or text selection. `chat-layout.ts` opts into the three-column gutter.
- Evidence: `test/unit/tui-scrollbar-interaction.test.ts` drives SGR press, motion, release and wheel events through VirtualTerminal, covering track jumps, thumb grabs, narrow terminals, content routing, selection, overlays and the actual fullscreen ChatLayout.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline provides equivalent reserved-gutter track and drag interaction and MCode migrates to it.

## L034: Regular viewport reconstruction after document changes

> L045 supersedes this entry's native-history reconstruction and clearing policy; the original behavior below is retained as historical context.

- Product contract: after running content or a feature panel closes, show the complete current chat viewport with its Composer and status line. Every current-session row must occur once in native history.
- Minimal difference: when a shorter document would move the viewport origin backwards, or changed visible text is already in scrollback, clear and replay the complete current projection, except for addressable text-only shrink covered by L038. Compare changed historical rows without terminal sequences so style-only updates preserve scrollback. Other updates retain differential rendering and genuine resize retains the existing delayed history replay.
- Tradeoff: structural reconstruction clears native scrollback, including shell history from before TUI startup. Initial short chat documents retain natural document placement. L038 keeps freed visible rows temporarily blank instead of reconstructing unchanged history.
- Evidence: local-delta tests assert every visible row and the complete history, while real Tasks and feature lifecycle tests cover short/long content, background growth, paging, resize, nested panels and return to chat. Queue lifecycle tests replay bracketed CJK paste, Alt+Enter, auto-drain, and history refresh through Ghostty; equal-height and growing historical edits are also covered by xterm. Virtual terminals do not establish native Windows Terminal or iTerm2 touchpad acceptance.
- Product boundary: the regular chat layout keeps rows that may still change out of native history (see L048), so this reconstruction remains for resize and for content that changes after being reported final.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline provides equivalent complete viewport and unique-history behavior.

## L036: Unframed multiline paste chunks

- Product contract: a plain-text stdin chunk containing an internal CR/LF is inserted as a single paste, so its CR bytes cannot submit each line separately.
- Minimal difference: `stdin-buffer.ts` emits the existing paste event before key splitting when there is no pending escape or bracketed paste and the chunk contains only text, tabs and line endings. The existing editor paste path normalizes CR/LF and tabs and folds large payloads.
- Boundary: this is a conservative fallback, not a replacement for bracketed paste. A standalone Enter and text followed only by a final Enter retain key semantics. Unframed pastes split into line-sized or character-sized chunks cannot be distinguished from typing and are not inferred using timing. Conversely, multiple typed lines delivered in a single chunk are indistinguishable from an unframed paste and use this fallback. Control sequences retain their existing parser.
- Evidence: `test/unit/tui-terminal-text-paste.test.ts` replays ProcessTerminal input into the product Editor, including CR, LF, CRLF, Unicode, large pastes, every bracketed chunk split, Enter/shortcuts, and stop/start mode lifecycle. The CR and CRLF cases submitted three separate messages before the fix. These are synthetic input replays, not real WSL terminal acceptance.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline provides equivalent unframed multiline input handling.

## L037: Commit the IME cursor with the regular-screen frame

- Product contract: a presented frame exposes the focused input's cursor position and visibility, including full redraws, differential updates, and deletion-only frames.
- Minimal difference: append cursor restoration to the bounded frame writer before ending synchronized output. Cursor-only updates retain the existing path. The product renderer separately defaults to a visible hardware cursor on Windows, where older ConPTY renderers can omit hidden cursor positions; explicit options and `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR` remain authoritative.
- Evidence: `test/unit/tui-ime-cursor.test.ts` replays terminal sequences at each synchronized-output boundary and exercises the product renderer, Composer, Editor, focus, mode switches, CJK wrapping, resize and shrink. Native Windows IME and ConPTY transport require separate acceptance.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline commits cursor restoration within the same synchronized frame.

## L038: Preserve native scrolling during visible content shrink

> L045 supersedes this entry's native-history reconstruction and clearing policy; the original behavior below is retained as historical context.

- Product contract: settling visible activity rows must not clear native scrollback or pin a scrolled host viewport to the top. The Composer and status remain at the bottom, and historical content remains unique.
- Minimal difference: when terminal geometry, the text already in scrollback and the declared transient layout keys are unchanged, absorb visible text-only shrink with blank rows at the current screen boundary before cursor extraction and differential rendering. L041 makes this an explicit background-content policy; unclassified layouts restore exposed rows. Subsequent output consumes the space before advancing native history. Ignore redundant same-size resize notifications without cancelling a genuine pending resize replay.
- Boundary: padding is confined to the active screen. Historical text replacement/removal, real resize, overlays and image reflow retain the structural reconstruction path. Blank rows can temporarily separate native history from the visible tail; this is preferable to clearing and replaying the terminal's scrollback during ordinary completion. No mouse capture is enabled in regular mode.
- Evidence: local-delta tests use xterm's host scroll API independently of the hardware cursor, reproduce the pre-fix jump to line zero, and verify stable scrolling, Composer position, unique history, reclaimed space, corrected-history reconstruction and resize behavior. The product queue/feature tests continue to cover canonical history replacement. Native Windows Terminal and UU Remote acceptance remain separate.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline preserves host scrolling and unique history through visible shrink.

## L039: Erase regular viewport redraws in place

> L045 supersedes this entry's native-history reconstruction and clearing policy; the original behavior below is retained as historical context.

- Product contract: repainting the visible regular-mode screen must not append the previous transcript, Composer or status line to native history.
- Minimal difference: viewport-only full redraws home the cursor, erase each screen row with EL 2 using cursor-down movement, and return home before painting. This avoids ED 2, which saves the old screen to scrollback in Apple Terminal. Full structural reconstruction still clears and rebuilds history.
- Evidence: local-delta tests exercise xterm and a clear-to-scrollback host model, covering historical style changes, simultaneous growth, short-document shrink, subsequent differential output, host scrolling and resize preview/replay. Native Apple Terminal replay of synthetic renderer output reproduces duplicate rows before the fix and preserves the exact document afterward.
- Boundary: native replay covers synthetic output, not every live-model interaction or other terminal emulator.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline supplies equivalent in-place viewport erasure without retaining stale rows in native history.

## L040: Coalesce synchronous submission renders

- Product contract: sending the next message removes the previous interrupted duration from the next presented frame, without rendering the same frame twice. When output is ready, submission generates that frame before the input callback returns; L044 permits asynchronous delivery and coalesces frames under backpressure.
- Minimal difference: queue the normal immediate input render before dispatching a focused component's key. A synchronous `renderNow()` during submission clears that queued request; ordinary keys still render on the next tick.
- User impact: the previous interrupted footer disappears with the submitted message, and the extra no-op render after Enter is avoided.
- Evidence: `tui-app.test.ts` checks every presented frame across interrupt and resend; `tui-engine-local-deltas.test.ts` checks that a synchronous input render has no second pass.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline coalesces synchronous input renders while preserving immediate key rendering.

## L041: Restore chat rows after transient layout shrink

> L045 supersedes this entry's native-history reconstruction and clearing policy; the original behavior below is retained as historical context.

- Product contract: shrinking a transient UI region restores the conversation instead of leaving released rows blank above it. Background activity shrink with unchanged transient layout retains L038's native scrolling behavior.
- Minimal difference: components may expose the layout key of their last rendered frame. MainScreen permits L038 padding only when every root explicitly supplies the same key and no overlay was present. ChatLayout includes every transient section's height and interaction state, while SurfaceHost includes the active feature. Unknown or changed layouts use L034 reconstruction only when scrolled rows must return. Keys are captured with native render state and cleared on reset. This replaces the earlier completion-specific resize callback and full-viewport close exception.
- Evidence: application tests replay `/theme`, `/settings`, prompt-history search, image-preview dismissal, multi-line draft clearing and completion filtering. Engine tests repeatedly expand/shrink each transient section under xterm and an ED 2 clear-to-scrollback model, compare the complete viewport, verify unique history, and retain positive background-activity scroll preservation. Short documents avoid unnecessary clearing.
- Boundary: full history reconstruction retains L034's shell-scrollback tradeoff. Emulator tests do not establish native terminal or live-service acceptance.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline distinguishes transient UI layout shrink from ordinary background content shrink.

## L042: Preserve product mention bindings in prompt history

- Product contract: plugin labels retain their exact identities while browsing history, including restoration of the working draft.
- Minimal difference: expose a generic history-text decoder and capture/restore the existing undo extension state alongside the history draft. Plugin parsing and identity ownership stay in the product Editor.
- Evidence: `tui-plugin-mentions.test.ts` covers repeated history navigation, identical display labels with different IDs, working-draft restoration, atomic deletion and undo.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline supports durable history decoding and draft extension state.

## L043: Preserve detached scrolling across layout changes

- Product contract: a detached fullscreen transcript remains detached when the viewport grows or content shrinks.
- Minimal difference: `ScrollView.updateLayout` clamps the scroll position without changing follow state. Explicit scrolling and follow requests retain their existing behavior.
- Evidence: `tui-scrollbar-interaction.test.ts` covers wheel detachment, viewport growth, footer/content shrink, temporarily fitting all content, subsequent output and re-arming with End.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline preserves follow state through layout clamping.

## L044: Keep terminal backpressure off the input loop

> L045 supersedes this entry's native-history reconstruction and clearing policy; the original behavior below is retained as historical context.

- Product contract: slow or paused POSIX terminal output must not block input or cancellation during long Regular-mode history reconstruction.
- Minimal difference: `terminal.ts` serializes POSIX TTY output through asynchronous, bounded `fs.write` operations, preserves partial UTF-8 writes, and reports output failures through the existing stdout error path. Controls share the same queue. `tui.ts` defers subsequent frames until output drains and then renders the latest model once. Ordinary stop queues any deferred final frame before terminal cleanup; mode switches preserve their previously captured render state. Mandatory final resize replay remains ordered before cleanup.
- Host integration: the observed terminal forwards the output state; shutdown, suspension and external-editor handoff drain queued output before another process owns the terminal. Input draining starts its idle window after keyboard-disable output is sent, and editor handoff rechecks shutdown after the drain.
- Evidence: terminal-output regressions cover held/partial writes, input dispatch, control ordering, transient and permanent failures, frame coalescing, final transcript preservation, keyboard input draining and editor handoff/shutdown races; application tests cover shutdown/suspend drains. A local macOS PTY with 10,000 synthetic history rows and a paused consumer no longer blocks the input loop while reconstructing history.
- Boundary: history reconstruction still transmits the complete ordered document. A stalled connection can delay visible output; it no longer synchronously stalls the JavaScript event loop. Windows and non-TTY output retain their existing writer. Native remote SSH and native Windows acceptance remain separate.
- Removal condition: the upstream terminal writer provides ordered asynchronous POSIX TTY writes and its render scheduler observes output backpressure.

## L045: Preserve regular-mode output snapshots

- Product contract: automatic projection folding and footer completion preserve host scrolling and shell history. Native scrollback records emitted snapshots; it is not a mutable copy of the latest canonical projection.
- Minimal difference: an optional `ScrollbackLayout` carries stable transcript row identities and a body/footer boundary through the public component API. MainScreen aligns a bounded logical cache at a shared nonblank row with unchanged text. Read groups identify individual member rows rather than the group's changing first cell. Later edits to already-emitted history do not replay it. Reclaimed rows remain between body and footer, preserving tables and the input cursor.
- Reconstruction: an unmatched projection commits the old visible body, erases addressable rows in place, and starts a labelled snapshot. It never emits ED 3 or uses ED 2. Footer overflow retains its physical offset; newly appended body rows are emitted before replacing the footer. Historical Kitty resources are not freed by a viewport repaint.
- Geometry: resize uses the hardware cursor's screen row to determine the retained origin. Safe anchors preserve every pending row, including a burst arriving during resize; an unalignable reflow starts a labelled snapshot. Forced redraw and regular/fullscreen state transfers retain physical coordinates and anchors.
- Transient screens: visible overlays share an alternate buffer until the last one closes. Main-buffer anchors and cursor geometry are retained independently through every resize; stop restores the main buffer before returning terminal ownership. Panel rows never enter native history.
- Evidence: engine and application regressions verify host scroll position, unique emitted rows, Todo completion, grouped reads and long-turn/turn-window eviction, contiguous tables, transient panels, cursor placement, bounded caches, oversized footers, resize bursts, image-resource lifetime, forced refresh, and mode-state restore under xterm and an ED 2 clear-to-scrollback model.
- Boundary: old native rows retain their historical text and wrapping. Explicit resume-start clearing is unchanged. Native remote-host and cross-platform acceptance remain separate from local emulator verification.
- Removal condition: the selected upstream engine supports immutable native output with bounded anchored live projections.


## L046: Avoid idle overlay output and short-conversation replay

- Product contract: unchanged isolated overlays emit no frame bytes. Changed text rows repaint in place; cursor-only movement still updates IME position. Short conversations retain native scroll position when background connection/account status or footer height changes while the welcome occupies history.
- Minimal difference: MainScreen caches one normalized overlay frame and its physical cursor visibility. Entry, exit, forced refresh, restore and each geometry transition invalidate the cache; image changes retain full-frame repaint. Base cursor-hiding control paths update the visibility cache so nested panels and coalesced preference changes restore the cursor.
- Short conversations: ChatLayout publishes welcome row anchors in document mode. With block metadata, prelude anchors have no block identity and are excluded from transcript-replacement detection. Shared welcome rows cannot hide a new session or projection eviction. The existing immutable-history alignment and body/footer padding apply before the first transcript row reaches native history.
- Evidence: `tui-scrollback-stability.test.ts` covers idle/one-row overlay output, physical cursor changes, force refresh, resize roundtrips, close/reopen, short-conversation background state and footer changes, unique warning emission, and real transcript replacement. Independent emulator checks cover account notice height changes, image fallback and lifecycle boundaries.
- Boundary: retained native welcome rows keep their emitted status; the current visible welcome and footer render current state. This does not change content-review decisions, runtime warning events or native-host guarantees.
- Removal condition: upstream provides differential isolated overlays and prelude-aware native-history alignment.


## L047: Preserve output identity and deferred main-buffer geometry

- Product contract: admitting an optimistic user message keeps its emitted history identity, including long prompts. Consecutive resizes preserve every output row even while writes are held or the fullscreen renderer owns the terminal. Switching modes snapshots main state after any final resize flush.
- Minimal difference: MainScreen tracks physical geometry separately from the last rendered frame and exposes the same resize calculation for an inactive saved main state. The base renderer forwards physical resize events to its owner before scheduling frames. Reflow that still fits on screen repaints in place; only potentially scrolled reflow needs an archived snapshot. Row alignment ignores declared layout padding and recognizes retained row identities when a source block id changes.
- Product integration: the transcript keeps canonical store ids while carrying an optional emitted-row identity across admission. ChatLayout publishes its outer padding. The interactive renderer observes inactive main-buffer resizes and captures state after stop has flushed pending output.
- Evidence: actual application submission tests cover three terminal sizes and a 120-line prompt. Scrollback tests cover five held-output resize sequences, three fullscreen resize sequences and a mode switch with a pending resized frame. Existing IME tests assert cursor position at synchronized frame boundaries after short-document width changes; overlay reflow tests retain overflowed history.
- Boundary: resize tracking models the existing local emulator host behavior. Native remote-host and cross-platform acceptance remain separate; genuinely unalignable history still starts a labelled snapshot.
- Removal condition: upstream retains emitted row identity through admission and tracks physical main-buffer geometry across deferred frames and renderer ownership changes.

## L048: Report committed Markdown lines

- Product contract: in Regular mode a streaming reply enters native scrollback only through rows that appended text cannot change, so a table, list or other block that is still growing never rewrites history.
- Minimal difference: `components/markdown.ts` exposes `getStableLineCount()`, the number of leading lines from the latest render that come from the blocks already committed by the L026 streaming cache. Rendering output is unchanged.
- Evidence: `tui-app.test.ts` regular-mode native history cases cover widening tables, lists that become loose, long prose that streams into history during a turn, and exact history after the run.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline exposes an equivalent committed-prefix contract for streaming Markdown.

## L049: Discard final rows already in native history

- Product contract: a long Regular-mode session keeps frame cost bounded without rewriting native scrollback.
- Minimal difference: `Component.takeDiscardedRows()` lets the root report leading rows it dropped since the last frame. When those rows are all above the previous viewport, `tui-main-screen.ts` drops them from its retained lines and rebases its viewport and cursor rows before diffing. Other cases keep the existing differential and reconstruction paths.
- Product boundary: the transcript only drops whole units of final rows far above the screen, so the remaining output is an exact suffix of the previous output. A later reconstruction, such as a resize, replays only the retained rows.
- Evidence: `tui-engine-local-deltas.test.ts` retained-document cases assert no scrollback erase and exact native history after trimming (failing without the rebase), and exact history without stale rows when a root reports too few or too many discarded rows.
- Removal condition: the selected Pi baseline supports discarding a committed document prefix.
