/**
 * Seed the recoverable-delete `rm` shim into `<dataDir>/shims/`.
 *
 * WHY A SHIM INSTEAD OF MORE COMMAND REWRITING
 * --------------------------------------------
 * "Every delete is recoverable" is an EXECUTION-layer promise. Rewriting
 * command text can only honour it for shapes a parser recognises, and that set
 * is never complete: `xargs rm`, `find … -exec rm {} \;`, or an `rm` inside a
 * shell script the agent just wrote all slip through, because the literal token
 * `rm` never appears where a rewriter can reach it.
 *
 * PATH resolution has no such blind spot. Whatever invokes `rm` — the agent
 * directly, `xargs`, `find`, or a nested script — the shell resolves the name
 * through PATH, so a shim at the front of PATH is reached in every case. The
 * permission layer therefore stays a pure judgement (allow / deny / ask) and the
 * sandbox stays a pure kernel-level interceptor; neither needs to know that
 * deletes are recoverable at all.
 *
 * WHY NOT `<dataDir>/bin`
 * ----------------------
 * `ensurePathIntegration` appends `<dataDir>/bin` to the USER's `~/.zshrc` /
 * `~/.bashrc`. Dropping an `rm` in there would silently replace `rm` in the
 * user's own interactive terminal, which we must never do. `<dataDir>/shims` is
 * injected only into the agent's bash environment (see `BashEnvPolicy.
 * prependPath`), never into a user-facing shell.
 *
 * Windows is intentionally skipped: it has no sandbox, and PowerShell resolves
 * `rm` as an alias for `Remove-Item` rather than through PATH, so recoverable
 * deletion stays on the existing host-side launcher there.
 *
 * Idempotent: only rewrites when the on-disk content differs.

/**
 * Delegates to the sibling `../bin/mavis-trash` rather than an absolute path so
 * the shim keeps working if the dataDir is moved or mounted elsewhere.
 *
 * `exec` replaces the shim process, so the caller observes mavis-trash's own
 * exit status and stderr directly — an `rm` failure must stay an `rm` failure.
 * Arguments are forwarded verbatim: mavis-trash already accepts rm's surface
 * (`-f`, `-r`/`-R`, `-rf`, `--`) and mirrors `rm -f`'s empty-operand success.
